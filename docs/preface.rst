Why DMX?
********

We at DMX describe DMX as "Knowledge Building Platform". You may wonder: "Are these people knowing what they're talking about? Is DMX one of these tech-affine companies which show a sloppy use of language? You know, these people who act and advocate their doing as if *Knowledge*, *Learning* (as misused in "machine learning"), and *Intelligence* (as misused in "artificial intelligence") would be terms which have their origin in computer science? These people who transfer terms which have their origin in philosophy and humanities for thousands of years -- terms which belong to the realm of life -- to the realm of machines and computability, as easy as a frog jumps from one water lily to another?" Well, this preface is for you.
