.. hint::

    | DMX requires **Java 8**.
    | It is not yet adapted to Java 9 or later.

    | In case you intend a networked DMX installation: Java is only required at server side then.
    | A Java browser plugin is *not* required.

Although DMX is a client-server application, installing it and launching the DMX Webclient for the first time, is as easy as buttering a toast:

1. `Download <https://dmx.berlin/download/>`_ the distribution zip file from DMX website.
2. Unzip it. Result is a folder named ``dmx-5.2``.
3. Open the folder and run the respective starter script for your platform:

   The starter script launches the DMX server while logging a lot information, and after a while opens a browser window showing the DMX Webclient.
