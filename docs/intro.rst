DMX lets you keep control of your data.
All data you enter are stored in the DMX database.
Where this database is stored depends on the way you decided to run DMX.

DMX on your local computer
==========================

If you downloaded DMX to your local computer and started it on there the database is stored on that same computer.
It does not leave it unless you copy it elsewhere.
After the initial download of the software, you can use DMX locally and without an internet connection unless you do need :ref:`Geomaps<user-geodata>`.
Geomaps are rendered in DMX with the help of `OpenStreetMap <https://www.openstreetmap.org>`_.
OpenStreetMap is also used to transform the addresses you entered into geographical coordinates.
Those features require an internet connection to work.

DMX as a self-hosted service
============================

If you are running DMX on your own server or if someone shares their self-hosted instance with you, your data are on that person's server.
To with DMX on a remote server you need an internet connection to communicate with the server.

DMX as a service hosted by us
=============================

If you use DMX on one of our demo sites or if you have a hosting contract with DMX Systems UG your data is stored on our server.
In this case you also need an internet connection to work with it.
